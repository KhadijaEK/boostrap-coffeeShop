# Coffee Shop (Bootstrap)


I redesigned an old website made in Bootstrap v.3 and upgraded it in Bootstrap v.5. The exercise was to design & create a responsive website of a fictitious coffee shop using/learning Bootstrap.

## About

![]()

This is a sample project creating a simple dark theme website with parallax effect, using default Boostrap components and styles, and CSS. It contains an index file that is the main page structure, a culture file and a style css file that modifies the layout of some aspects in the index file when adjustments were necessary.



**Restaurant concept**: This is Fresh-oh! Coffee-house where you can relax and enjoy our delicious home-made brew coffees & snacks.
